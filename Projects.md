### 1. [Project 1 : Inter-satellite (GEO-LEO) Interference Monitoring]

* **Duration** : April 2025 - October 2025
* Description : This project aims to prevent interference and signal jamming for **GEO** (Geostationary Orbit) users by developing monitoring algorithms and scenarios for LEO satellites. We've created algorithms to determine how many more **GS** (Ground Stations) need to be constructed to accurately monitor LEO satellites passing over South Korea.
* Technology Stack : Matlab, Python, AI

### 2. [Project 2 : Development of Next-Generation Wireless Communication Standard Technologies Using LEO Satellites]

* **Duration** : September 2025 - Present
* Description : This project aims to develop next-generation wireless communication standard technologies by integrating 6G NTN with LEO, CubeSats. We designed the satellite mission and analyzed system requirements to converge high-resolution Earth Observation with communication functions. Additionally, we designed the Telemetry & Telecommand interface and developed a simulator to verify command sequences and data transmission protocols between the CubeSat and GS.
* Technology Stack : Matlab, Python, AI,
