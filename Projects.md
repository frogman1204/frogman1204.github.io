### 1. [Project 1 : Inter-satellite (GEO-LEO) Interference Monitoring]

* **Duration** : April 2025 - October 2025
* Description : This project aims to prevent interference and signal jamming for **GEO** (Geostationary Orbit) users by developing monitoring algorithms and scenarios for LEO satellites. We've created algorithms to determine how many more **GS** (Ground Stations) need to be constructed to accurately monitor LEO satellites passing over South Korea.
* Technology Stack : Matlab, Python, AI
