### 1. [Project 1 : Inter-satellite (GEO-LEO) Interference Monitoring]

* **Duration** : April 2025 - October 2025
* Description : This project aims to prevent interference and signal jamming for **GEO** (Geostationary Orbit) users by developing monitoring algorithms and scenarios for LEO satellites. We've created algorithms to determine how many more **GS** (Ground Stations) need to be constructed to accurately monitor LEO satellites passing over South Korea.
* Technology Stack : Matlab, Python, AI

### 2. [Project 2 : Development of Next-Generation Wireless Communication Standard Technologies Using LEO Satellites]

* **Duration** : September 2025 - Present
* Description : This project aims to develop next-generation wireless communication standard technologies by integrating 6G NTN (Non-Terrestrial Networks) with LEO (Low Earth Orbit) CubeSats (16~24U). We designed the satellite mission and analyzed system requirements to converge high-resolution EO (Earth Observation) with communication functions. Additionally, we designed the TM/TC (Telemetry & Telecommand) interface and developed a simulator to verify command sequences and data transmission protocols (such as CCSDS and CSP) between the CubeSat and GS (Ground Stations).
