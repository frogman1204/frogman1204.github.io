Hello! I'm Yonggyun Kim, an undergraduate student in **Information and Communication Engineering** at **Incheon National University**. As an undergraduate researcher, I'm actively involved in the **Next-Generation Communication and Intelligent Systems Lab (NCISL)**. My primary research interests lie in **satellite communication** and **nonlinear communication signals**.

My goal is to integrate **AI methodologies** into these fields, focusing on **pattern recognition** and **Deep Learning** to achieve **clearer and more precise objectives**. I'm driven to explore how advanced intelligent systems can enhance our understanding and manipulation of complex communication signals, particularly within the challenging domain of **satellite communications**.
