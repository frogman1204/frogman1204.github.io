Hello! I’m Yonggyun Kim, an undergraduate student in Information and Communication Engineering at Incheon National University and an active undergraduate researcher at the Next-Generation Communication and Intelligent Systems Lab (NCISL).

My research is dedicated to pioneering the foundational technologies for Beyond 5G and 6G wireless systems. My primary interests lie at the intersection of several key domains:
* Ambient Backscatter Communication (AmBC) : Exploring how devices can modulate information by reflecting existing ambient RF signals, realizing battery-free and ultra-low-power connectivity for massive IoT.
* Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) : Exploring the integration of satellite and aerial platforms to provide seamless and ubiquitous connectivity for the 6G era.
* Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) : Exploring interference management strategies by splitting messages into common and private parts, achieving robust spectral efficiency and massive connectivity.
* Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) : Unifying wireless transmission and radar sensing into a single platform, enabling simultaneous high-speed data connectivity and high-precision environmental perception.

My ultimate goal is to synthesize these cutting-edge fields within the framework of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC). I am focused on leveraging AI and Deep Learning methodologies to design systems where heterogeneous elements—ranging from satellite platforms (NTN) to backscattering devices (AmBC) are not only used for communication but also for high-precision sensing. Through this research, I am driven to contribute to a future with smarter, more efficient, and hyper-aware wireless networks.
