Hello! Iâ€™m Yonggyun Kim, an undergraduate student in Information and Communication Engineering at Incheon National University and an active undergraduate researcher at the Next-Generation Communication and Intelligent Systems Lab (NCISL).

My research is dedicated to pioneering the foundational technologies for Beyond 5G and 6G wireless systems. My primary interests lie at the intersection of several key domains:
* Communication Channel Estimation : Developing robust and efficient algorithms to accurately model the wireless channel, which is fundamental for reliable communication.
* Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) : Investigating how these smart surfaces can be controlled to intelligently manipulate radio waves, creating a programmable and favorable communication environment.
* Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) : Exploring the integration of satellite and aerial platforms to provide seamless and ubiquitous connectivity for the 6G era.

My ultimate goal is to synthesize these cutting-edge fields within the framework of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC). I am focused on leveraging AI and Deep Learning methodologies to design systems where NTN and RIS are not only used for communication but also for high-precision sensing. Through this research, I am driven to contribute to a future with smarter, more efficient, and hyper-aware wireless networks.
