## Homepage Introduction: Architecting the Future of 6G Communication

### Pioneering Seamless Connectivity and Awareness with Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) and Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)

As an Information and Communication Engineering researcher passionate about the next frontier of global connectivity, my work is centered on the core technologies shaping the 6G era. I am currently engaged in advanced research focusing on two of its most transformative pillars: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) and Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC).

My research strives to create a unified framework where satellite and aerial platforms are seamlessly integrated with terrestrial infrastructure, delivering truly ubiquitous connectivity. Concurrently, I am developing novel techniques for ISAC, enabling communication systems to perform high-precision environmental sensing using the very same signals that carry data. By designing innovative signal processing algorithms and AI-driven solutions, I aim to overcome the unique challenges at the intersection of these domains—enhancing spectral efficiency, ensuring robust performance, and unlocking new applications.

This research serves as a critical foundation for building an intelligent, resilient, and hyper-aware communication infrastructure. The ultimate goal is to contribute to a future where connectivity is not only global but also context-aware, paving the way for advancements in autonomous systems, environmental monitoring, and beyond.
