### Advancing Satellite Signal Intelligence for Next-Generation Communication

As an Information and Communication Engineering student with a keen interest in **satellite communication**, I'm currently engaged in research focused on the **detection and sensing of nonlinear and anomalous satellite signals**. My work aims to effectively identify and analyze critical information within **complex and unpredictable satellite signals**.

I leverage **cutting-edge signal processing techniques** to **detect anomalous signal patterns** that are challenging to discern with conventional methods, and to enhance **signal sensing performance in nonlinear satellite communication environments**. This research will serve as a **crucial foundation** for strengthening the **reliability and security** of future satellite systems and enabling **more efficient data transmission**.

Beyond simple signal analysis, my research seeks to unlock **new possibilities in satellite communication** and contribute to **real-world applications**. For more detailed insights into my research projects and latest achievements, please refer to the dedicated sections available at the top of this page.
